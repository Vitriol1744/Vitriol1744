## 🧠 About Me

I'm a self-taught systems programmer and a student at The Military University of Technology in Warsaw who enjoys building things from the ground up — from custom kernels and memory allocators to emulators, developer tooling, and game engines. 

I love precision, performance, and learning through building. If it runs close to hardware or helps developers work better, I’m probably working on it.

### 🔎 Interests
- Operating systems, memory layout, interrupts, scheduling
- Modern C++ internals: templates, allocators, metaprogramming
- Graphics engines, Vulkan, and real-time rendering
- Data structures, performance tuning, and system architecture

## 📌 My Projects

### 🔐 [CryptixOS](https://github.com/CryptixOS/CryptixOS.git)
Unix-like OS focused on modularity and security  
> with many drivers (nvme, pci, e1000e, acpi, i8042, lapic, ioapic), filesystems (tmpfs, devtmpfs, procfs, ext2fs, fat32fs), a lot of syscalls, and bunch of usefull utilities ported, such as: coreutils, bash, util-linux, cmatrix, find, vim, nano, and xorg being ported).

---

### 📚 [Prism](https://github.com/CryptixOS/Prism.git)
C++ standard library alternative
> Custom containers, `BasicString` with SSO, allocators, intrusive lists, type traits, and more. Built for consistency and performance.

---

### 🎮 [Vortex-Engine](https://github.com/Vitriol1744/Vortex.git)
C++ game engine built on Vulkan  
> Consists of 3d level editor, any easy to use API, supporting: logging, profiling, serialization, rendering and cross-platform support(Win32, X11, Wayland).

---

### ⚡ [Fastscan (Port Scanner)](https://github.com/vitriol1744/PortScanner.git)
Multithreaded C++ port scanner  
> Built for speed, scans thousands of ports or hosts with raw sockets. After initial port detection it runs nmap on detected ports to perform service detection(Can be disabled with a flag).
